Q) Given:

var b = (byte)126;
outer:
for (var n = 1000; n < 1002; n++) {
  for (var j = 4; j >= 0; j--, b++) {
    if (j < 3) break;
    else if (n == 1001) continue outer;
    b++;
  }
}
System.out.printf("b = %d\n", b);

What is the output
A) b = 129
B) b = 130
C) b = -126
D) b = -128
E) an exception is thrown

Q) Given:
class RCToy {
  private static int count = 0;
  private int age;

  public RCToy() {
    count++;
  }

  public RCToy(int age) {
    this();
    this.age = age;
    System.out.println(this);
  }

  @Override
  public String toString() {
    return "RCToy for age " + age + ", count " + count;
  }
}

// and:
class Robot extends RCToy implements Serializable {
  private int weaponCount;

  public Robot(int weaponCount) {
    super(weaponCount == 0 ? 3 : 10);
    this.weaponCount = weaponCount;
    System.out.println(this);
  }

  @Override
  public String toString() {
    return super.toString() + " a Robot with weaponcount = " + weaponCount;
  }
}

// Given an attempt to create and serialize a Robot like this:
    Robot r = new Robot(3);
    ByteArrayOutputStream baos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
    try (ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(baos)) {
      oos.writeObject(r);
    } catch (IOException ioe) {
      System.out.println("write failed");
    }
// What will be output by this code:
    try (ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(
        new ByteArrayInputStream(baos.toByteArray()))) {
      Object obj = ois.readObject();
      System.out.println(obj);
    } catch (Exception ioe) {
      System.out.println("read failed");
    }

A) RCToy for age 0, count 2 a Robot with weaponcount = 0
   RCToy for age 0, count 2 a Robot with weaponcount = 3
   RCToy for age 0, count 2 a Robot with weaponcount = 3
B) RCToy for age 0, count 1 a Robot with weaponcount = 0
   RCToy for age 0, count 1 a Robot with weaponcount = 3
C) RCToy for age 0, count 1 a Robot with weaponcount = 3
   RCToy for age 0, count 1 a Robot with weaponcount = 3
D) RCToy for age 0, count 2 a Robot with weaponcount = 3
E) Compilation fails
F) An exception is thrown during serialization
G) An exception is thrown during deserialization
